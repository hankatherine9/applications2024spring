<h2>Evaluation Algorithm</h2>
<p>
    Each user story is evaluated based on three criteria: commonality, achievability, and priority to the persona. Each
    of these three are given a rating from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest). My group made a column that calculated the average
    of these three scores. I looked through the mean scores and adjusted certain user stories when I deemed it
    beneficial. Essentially, there were certain mean scores of 2 that I thought should be "must haves," so I changed the
    score to 3, and there were certain scores of 3 that I didn't think were "must haves," so I changed the score to 2. I
    assumed that user stories with an average score of 1 were truly not important to consider in comparison to the other
    user stories.
