        <p class="question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and
            configuring the
            specific product?</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li>
                I saw a top navigation bar, and when you hover over one of the categories it reveals more subcategories
                that relate to the main one. You can really narrow your search though that ability.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also further narrow your search through filters above the product images. There are pictured
                categories (i.e. stud, hoop, statement, etc.) and more traditional filters below that with check boxes
                on basic jewelry shopping characteristics like materials and price. When you hover over the picture, it
                brings up a condensed version of the product page where you can click through pictures and add to cart.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you have selected a specific product, the product page has a more basic view at the top, featuring
                simple imagery, description, and add to cart button. As you scroll down, it becomes more detailed,
                describing the collection it’s a part of and highlighting similar products the consumer might be
                interested in.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you click to add to cart, a sidebar opens showing what product you added and it encourages you to
                check out. The bag in the right hand corner turns blue and shows you the number of items in it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Shopping Bag page features the product you added and an order summary, estimating tax and delivery.
                Below, it also shows other products you might also like.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, I’ve seen all these features on websites, especially fashion websites. It makes window shopping easier
            and an actual sale more possible. Everything pushes you towards finding what you need and more through
            filters and extra suggestions.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, I’ve interacted with and encountered all these elements before on precious websites. And even if they
            looked different (i.e. the Tiffany bag instead of the traditional basket/cart), I knew what they were
            because of the placement on the page.
        </p>
        <p class="question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            It’s designed to help the user buy products they need and then some. Each element works to usher them
            towards checkout and paying.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Tiffany’s website’s main goal is to make a sale. Through using familiar navigation, pertinent filters, extra
            shopping suggestions, and clearly emphasized buttons, they guide the user towards buying.

        <h4>Item: Shoes</h4>
        <p class="question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and
            configuring the
            specific product?</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li>
                There is a top navbar, and from hovering over the menu items, I can see subcategories to further narrow
                my search.
            </li>
            <li>
                The filters are on the left side and are a little awkward to scroll through, but can be hidden. Users
                can choose from a myriad of filters ranging from shoe style to what’s trending.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hovering over the product images gives a different view to the show and also shows other available
                colors. An add to cart button is also revealed and when clicked the sizing remains in the hover area.
            </li>
            <li>
                After a specific item is selected, the product page features simple product imagery along with actual
                pictures of purchasers and reviews. You can pick a size and add to cart.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the add to cart button is clicked, it opens a sidebar that shows what you’ve just added and the
                estimated delivery. The cart icon on the right upper corner shows the number of items in it. The
                checkout button is emphasized through color. On the Your Cart page, it features what’s in the cart and a
                cart summary on the right with the total costs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, especially in the context of fashion websites. Using filters and visual language like this, makes
            shopping easier and more efficient.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Yes, the Converse website plays off of what others have done for sure. Everything, except the filters, was
            where I expected it to be and had the look I’m used to seeing.
        </p>
        <p class="question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            All the elements are designed to direct the user towards making a purchase.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            It was used in a commercial context and it was successful. From using convention, Converse makes a mostly
            pain free shopping process, ensuring that the typical user knows how to get from point a to point b.

        <h4>Item: Waterbottle</h4>
        <p class="question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and
            configuring the
            specific product?</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li>
                I saw a top navigation bar, and at full width there are broad categories in the navigation bar
                that reveal more subcategories when you hover over them. At a certain breakpoint, the navigation bar
                changes
                to have more specific options and has a horizontal scroll.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you selected a certain category, in our case
                the "Drinkware" category, then there was a filter button you could click. Once clicked, a list of filter
                categories appeared on the left side of the screen. The filter categories each had a plus sign button
                next
                it that had a drop down when you clicked on it to show specifics (i.e. The "Color" category drops down
                to
                show the different available colors). I also saw hover states for the product images
            </li>
            <li>
                After we selected a
                specific bottle, there were thumbnails of different colors, buttons with different sizes, and related
                products you can also add to the cart.
            </li>
            <li>
                After adding the product to the cart, a column with the added item swipes in from the right of
                the screen, and you can click the shopping bag icon at the top right to access "Your Bag". This page had
                an
                element to input your zip code for estimated shipping cost, and on the right side of the page is an
                "Order
                Summary" with shipping cost, estimated total, and a checkout button.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I have seen the top navigation bar in many websites, not just online stores. I have also seen hover
            state animations on photos in portfolio websites as well. Additionally, drop down menus are a common
            element of many websites’ navigation system.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I knew what to do with many of the elements I listed before I interacted with them because I encountered
            similar features many times before in other websites.
        </p>
        <p class="question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            The navigation bar with many subcategories and filters are designed to handle the general problem of
            different users having different preferences and therefore wanting a way to easily find results that they
            would want while still keeping all the options available for all users. The hover states on pictures can
            have many different purposes, but a common problem it handles is showing different aspects of the page the
            picture is linked to without making the user click the link immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            The navigation system is used in this context to help consumers easily find specific Yeti products while
            keeping all options open for consumers who are unsure about exactly what they want or if they want a Yeti
            product at all. The hover states on pictures in this context is used to show a different angle of the
            specific Yeti product. I would say all of these elements were successful.

        <a href="https://www.thediceshoponline.com/">The Dice Shop</a>
        <h4>Item: Dice</h4>
        <p class="question">What UI elements did I see and/or interact with while finding, comparing, selecting, and
            configuring the
            specific product?</p>
        <ul class="answer">
            <li>
                At the top I saw a search bar and navigation bar. Below that I saw a picture carousel that highlighted
                different dice sets and sales. Then below that I saw filter dropdown buttons and a featured items
                carousel. At the very top right corner I also saw three currency buttons to switch between pounds,
                euros, and dollars.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you click on a category, in this case "Dice & Dice Sets", there is not just a singular filter
                button that displays a list of categories when selected but instead five filter dropdown buttons lined
                up above the product listings. These filter dropdown buttons are repeats of the ones on the home page.
                Additionally, the listings on this page were not actually for one specific product but for a subcategory
                (i.e. Gemstone Dice). Under these subcategories are buttons that say "View Range", which indicates that
                there is a variety of products to choose from when you click it.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you click a subcategory like Gemstone Dice, you can select sets (which also have the "View Range"
                buttons beneath them), and when you click a set, you can choose to add the whole set or individual dice
                from the set. There "Add to cart" buttons, and once clicked, there is a “Added to cart” notice banner
                with a hyperlink to the shopping cart.
            </li>
            <li>
                On the shopping cart page, there is a boudning box around the added items, and a "Continue Shopping"
                button at the bottom left of the box. On the bottom right of the box there are two buttons: "Clear
                Shopping Cart" and "Update Shopping Cart". There are two proceed to checkout buttons: above and to the
                right of the box and one below and to the right (at the bottom of a "Summary" with shipping and order
                total).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="question">Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I have seen all of the elements I mentioned in other contexts before except for the currency buttons.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Did I know what this element would do before I interacted with it? Why?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I knew what to do with the elements I listed before I interacted with them because I encountered similar
            features many times before in other websites. I also used context clues to fill in the gaps when I
            encountered something new like recognizing the dollar sign to infer the usage of the currency buttons.
        </p>
        <p class="question">What general problem is this element designed to handle?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            The elements listed are generally used to navigate and narrow down a search or feature specific results.
        </p>
        <p class="question">Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            The elements were used to highlight certain dice sets and sales to users and also to help guide them to the
            products that they would want most. They were mostly successful in terms of function, but the navigation
            system and buttons of this website are not particularly aesthetic.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p class="question">What elements or patterns seem universal?</p>
    <p class="answer">Most of the elements we listed, including top navigation bar, filters, and add to cart buttons,
        seemed universal. It also seemed universal that the shopping cart icon was in the top right corner.
        Additionally, three out of the four stores had hover states for their product thumbnails so the user could see a
        different picture of the product.</p>
    <p class="question">Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</p>
    <p class="answer">
        The currency buttons on the dice website were different from anything I've seen before.
    </p>
    <p class="question">What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</p>
    <p class="answer">
        Highlighting the fabric was unique to Converse since it was the only store whose products were made with fabric.
        Yeti seemed to the only store that prominently featured "Shop by Color" options outside of just the color filter
        category. The Dice Shop had a unique navigation system that broke down the products into even more
        subcategories.
    </p>
    <p class="question">Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have
        applied that technique successfully?</p>
    <p class="answer">Converse's website had something from the others, which was icons on the thumbnails of the
        products that denoted pros of the material that the specific shoe was made of (i.e. waterproof). I think the
        other stores could also utilize an icon system to help the user quickly identify perks of certain items that the
        user may not necessarily think about from the start. For example, Yeti could create an icon system that showed
        which products could fit in cupholders.</p>
    <p class="question">Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most
        comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</p>
    <p class="answer">I was most comfortable when the websites follwed conventions I have seen before. I was confused
        and bothered when certain design elements were repeated or a single design element had two overlapping
        funcitons. For example, when you hover over the the cart button on the Tiffany & Co. website, a side bar with
        your shopping bag appears, but it takes a moment to load, so if you also click the icon in that time, you get
        the side bar appear as the shopping bag page itself loads.</p>
