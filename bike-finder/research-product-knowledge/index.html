    <h2>What kind of bike do I want?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I wanted a bike that was small enough for my small stature, so I googled “bike size chart”. I found from a
            road bike size chart from the article <a
                href="https://www.thebikeshoppe.com/articles/bike-size-guide-pg1486.htm">The Bike Shoppe: Bike Size
                Charts For Men, Women, and Kids</a>, and the best size for my height (4’11”) is size 47 with an inseam
            28.0" - 29.5".
        </li>
        <li>
            I also wanted a bike suited for commuting through the city, so I googled "what bike should I get for the
            city”. I found an article called <a
                href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting">Best commuter
                bike | What's the best bike for commuting in 2024?
            </a> and discovered that the types of bikes that would suit my purposes would be hybrid bikes, road commuter
            bikes, and/or city bikes. For which websites to use, I simply googled "where to buy bikes online".

        href="https://retrospec.com/collections/bikes?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=category-bike-general&nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ag%3A17058983501%3A131166788570%3A620173413523&nb_adtype=&nb_kwd=buy%20bike&nb_ti=kwd-39287842&nb_mi=&nb_pc=&nb_pi=&nb_ppi=&nb_placement=&nb_li_ms=&nb_lp_ms=&nb_fii=&nb_ap=&nb_mt=e&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAwbitBhDIARIsABfFYIKeLw-bzW4VkUzs8pwRyItAVjtqsu5g5eMWZ4Jfpx5b9NbAtqtig-gaAiQ_EALw_wcB">Retrospec</a>

        <li>
            To find a bike that suited my needs, I first went to Bikes > City Bikes. There were five listings, and the
            first one had a nice range of colors. However, upon clicking the product, I could not easily find
            information about how short the seat went, and because I did not want to risk the bike being too big for me,
            The same issue occurred with the second and fourth listings. The third and fifth listings, though, did have
            different sizes, and they both had a small size that was suited for heights from 5’ 2” to 5’ 5”. Not ideal,
            but I could still probably learn to use it.
        </li>
        <li>
            I then moved onto browsing the Hybrid Bikes, which also had five listings. The first one didn’t have size
            options, so I skipped over it. The second listing had sizes, but the Small was for heights 5’ 5” to 5' 8”
            and that size was sold out anyway. When I got to the third listing, I knew it was the best option so far
            because there was an X-Small option that was intended for rider heights 5’ to 5’ 3”. The last two listings
            had Small options, but no X-Small options, and because the Small sizes were consistent across the website, I
            decided that the only bike on this website that I might reasonably buy was the one that came in X-Small, the
            Barron Comfort Hybrid Bike - Step Through 21 Speed. It was also a reasonable price for a bike at $299.99.
            There’s no point to me buying a bike that is too tall for me to ride, so I had to eliminate all other
            options.

    </ul>

    <a class="website" href="https://www.bikesonline.com/">Bike Shop Online USA</a>

    <ul>
        <li>
            This website had more subcategories, so I decided to go to City & Hybrid > Cruiser & Comfort. I was looking
            for a bike to simply get around and one that wouldn’t be too expensive, so I decided to not look at options
            like “Fitness & Urban” or “eUrban”. On the filters to the left of the screen, I checked “In-Stock” and there
            were only three listings. The first listing had a size for riders 5’1” to 5’ 7”. However, there was also a
            “Find my Size” above the size drop down, so I took the short survey that asked for my height, leg height,
            and arm length. It said the specific bike I was looking at was not suited for me, but that it would give me
            a list of bikes that would.
        </li>
        <li>
            It gave me four listings, and I decided to skip over the two beach cruisers because that was not my intended
            use for the bikes. That left me with two viable options, albeit both more expensive than the bike I found on
            Retrospec. Now having gone through two websites, I was realizing how difficult it was to find bikes for
            people my height, but I appreciate that this website allowed me to input my height to immediately get a list
            of bikes that would suit me instead of me having to look through all the listings manually.

        <li>
            I went to Adult Bikes > Road Bikes. I had some initial trouble trying to narrow the searches to bikes that
            would suit my height because for size I could only filter by wheel size, but I didn’t know the correlation
            between wheel size and rider height. However, after I randomly selected 14” for the wheel size, the only
            listing with that size thankfully had a “Size guide” button above the different sizes for the bike, and I
            discovered 24” to 26” wheels would be best for my height.
        </li>
        <li>
            There were no 24” road bikes available, so I just selected the 26” filter. 15 listings resulted, which was
            more options than I had for the other two websites, and they were all relatively affordable. Because I had
            more options to choose from, I decided to also choose color filters. It was definitely nice to have at least
            a few more options to choose from, but I think having too many would be too overwhelming.
